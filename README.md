# Collaboration Documents for the Personal Genome Projects

## Mission Statement

1. We believe that people can make a fully informed decision to release their data completely into the public, and in fact, given the difficulty and indeed impossibility of making genomic data fully anonymous, we believe that our approach is the most responsible approach possible.

2. We believe in giving participants the tools, skills, and knowledge to participate as equals in the healthcare process who bring insight into and hypothesis derived from their own lives, while helping them understand and appreciate the complexity of medicine and science and bolster their trust that the healthcare system is working on their behalf.

## Feature List for Software Infrastructure

1. Facilitate participants **enrolling in studies**, and the **return of data** from those studies to participants
2. Facilitate external researchers being able to **find and access public (released) data**
3. In a **structured manner**, facilitate participants **uploading additional healthcare data**, such as 23andme, health records, etc.
4. Facilitate distribution of additional surveys through **mobile interface**
5. Real-time overview of status of **PGP projects around the world**
6. **Diversity outreach** / accountability, publishing statistics front-and-center and reaching out to trusted community members across the racial, ethnic, economic, and geographic axis
7. Create a hub for **researchers** in public genomics to **connect to each other** (thus genomics research that's replicable and involves public data.
8. Create a hub for **participants to connect to each other** and answer each other’s questions (stackoverflow or biostars-esque.
9. Create a streamlined and easy-to-adopt process for **status tracking** (for use internally and for communicating to participants what’s going on)
10. Establish well-documented **fundraising and marketing/publicity channels or partnerships** in order to keep the PGP alive, support our participants, support researchers, and get the word out to ensure diversity of our participant pool (diversity doesn’t happen by default!.. Documentation ensures that our actions are always in align with our stated motives, building trust in the PGP (crowdfunding, foundations...)
11. **Public outreach and education** (hands-on / interactive... museum exhibits, classes, etc.)
12. **Data visualization** team (host a hackathon?), including genome+phenotype browser
