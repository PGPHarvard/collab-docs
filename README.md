# Collaboration Documents for the Personal Genome Projects
This document is a draft and a work-in-progress!

## Feature List for Software Infrastructure & for PGP as a Whole

1. Facilitate participants **enrolling in studies**, and the **return of data** from those studies to participants
2. Facilitate external researchers being able to **find and access public (released) data**
3. In a **structured manner**, facilitate participants **uploading additional healthcare data**, such as 23andme, health records, etc.
4. Facilitate distribution of additional surveys through **mobile interface**
5. Real-time overview of status of **PGP projects around the world**
6. **Diversity outreach** / accountability, publishing statistics front-and-center and reaching out to trusted community members across the racial, ethnic, economic, and geographic axis
7. Create a hub for **researchers** in public genomics to **connect to each other** (thus genomics research that's replicable and involves public data.
8. Create a hub for **participants to connect to each other** and answer each other’s questions (stackoverflow or biostars-esque.
9. Create a streamlined and easy-to-adopt process for **status tracking** (for use internally and for communicating to participants what’s going on)
10. Establish well-documented **fundraising and marketing/publicity channels or partnerships** in order to keep the PGP alive, support our participants, support researchers, and get the word out to ensure diversity of our participant pool (diversity doesn’t happen by default!.. Documentation ensures that our actions are always in align with our stated motives, building trust in the PGP (crowdfunding, foundations...)
11. **Public outreach and education** (hands-on / interactive... museum exhibits, classes, etc.)
12. **Data visualization** team (host a hackathon?), including genome+phenotype browser
