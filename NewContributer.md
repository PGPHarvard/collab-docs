# New Contributor Guide 

This document is a draft and a work-in-progress!

## Todo

Make it take less than 20 minutes to get a working install (Tapestry or GET-Evidence or any other system) 

## Possible Three-hour Projects

In terms of projects we think would be appealing or fulfilling, we think they would fall into three categories:

* Visualizations
  * PGP downloads around the world
  * Enrollment reports / network graph
* Analyzing Data
  * Machine learning on the variants in Untap
* Work that needs to be done
  * List of what PGP data is being used for around the world
  * Add licenses to consent documents
  * Add FAQ to website
